# Final Project - Part I

## Outline
As part of my final project I wanted to focus on animal welfare as it holds a soft spot for me as a former pet owner. The topic I wanted to focus on through my data visualization is that pet owners who have recently become pet owners, or have been one for long now stay away from rehoming their pets in general, especially post pandemic. Pet rehoming has complicated implications especially for the animals who go through multiple homes and family changes that affect them emotionally. The main idea through this data visualization is also to depict how pets rehoming has reduced especially post the pandemic which talks about how pandemic restrictions, work from home has had an impact on pet owners. 

### Setup
Many pets - mostly dogs and cats are considered for this data visualization, have been surrendered by their owners for numerous reasons pre pandemic thus owing to rehoming of these pets

### Conflict
Pets that were surendered get rehomed, which stimulates anxiety, fear and sadness in many. Pet owners have multiple reasons to relinquish their pets that range from personal problems like allergies or a new baby in house to financial issues for pet supplies and medical care and majorly ample time to spend with their pets

### Resolution
In recent years pets being rehomed has been reduced owing to increased adoption and pandemic impact that have made pet owners more open to keeping their pets. There is also improvement in terms of animal shelters providing assistance to pet owners.

## Supporting Data
There are couple of researches that involved in understanding re-homing, relinquishment/ surrendering by owners and COVID impacts on pet adoption or retention
<br/>
Firstly, I learned about re-homing from a ASPCA's Scientific Research publishing article - "Goodbye to a Good Friend: An Exploration of the Re-Homing of Cats and Dogs in the U.S." This article has a compehensive analysis on the who, what and how are animals being replaced in the US. Demographics of people re-homing pets, their reasons and ways of re-homing as well as the statistics for how many pets category wise (dogs and cats) have been studied throuh surveys and data collected from animal shelters. A telephonic survey was conducted to ask people 14 questions related to re-homing, to understand the reasons and frequency of rehoming. These 14 questions were eventually divided into four buckets as main reasons: 1. pet-related- behavioral issues or health issues that couldn't be handled 2. family-related- personal problems like allergies or new baby in home or divorce or lack of time 3. housing-related- landlord had a no pets policy or new house had carpet issues that could be maybe cause allergies for the animal 4. other. This survey also asked questions to pet owners that what would be potential resources that would have helped them retain their pets. 

Secondly, owners reliquishing their pets or the net in and out number of pets in animal shelter from the data by Animal Humane Scoiety. This organization has monthly and yearly reports on the intake and outcome results of pet in animal shelters of US. Their intake report consists of categories - Stray, Owner Surrender, Returns, Transfer from another agency, Cruelty and outcome consists of categories - Adoption, Return to owner, Transfer out, Euthanasia, Died/ Lost in shelter care. The Shelter Animals Count also has detailed data on the Net intake and Outcome of pets for the past three years that I would be using for telling my story.

Thirdly, I've used ASPCA again and a research paper on "Characterizing Pet Acquisition and Retention During the COVID-19 Pandemic" to analyze how the trend of pet relinquishing and retention has changed during the pandemic and post-pandemic. While the ASPCA results show that post-pandemic there has been an improvement in retention with 87% of dog and cat owners not considering re-homing, the research paper focuses more the duration during the pandemic and has results that show that net intake and outcome have not changed significantly but this also could not be fully accurate due to the pandemic restrictions.

## Method and Medium
I will use Shorthand for showing my story. For the charts, I'll make use of Tableau and Flourish. <br/>
In Shorthand, the idea I have in my mind is to make use of the Text over Media to have my project title over a media that shows an image of a happy pet in a home where people are probably working on their laptops (to emphasize harmony during pandemic which led to retention). Since, this is the first photo that the reader will see, I think it needs to be one that provokes a wholesome happy emotion so that they can get interested and continue reading. I will then use "Reveal" feature of Shorthand to show a story of images in the order - an owner relinquishing their pet to an animal shelter, pet in the animal shelter probably looking sad and distressed, pet being rehomed to another family (still seeming confused and unhappy), then a pandemic photo and a lockdown image, pets looking happier at their homes as their human owner is present with them more than before, owner enjoying pet company. While these images are being scrolled down, I will simlutaneously explain the idea behind the project using the "Scrollmation" feature. I will then depict some statistics and charts to show how the story speaks in terms of numbers and visualize using graphsthat are more interactive. I will have one section that has all the charts pulled from tables for readers who are more interested in the details behind the story. At the end I would like to have a "Call for Action" section where the highlighted message would be "Make your pets your family and don't give up on them!"
