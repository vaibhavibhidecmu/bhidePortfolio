# Final Project - Part I

## Outline
As part of my final project I wanted to focus on animal welfare as it holds a soft spot for me as a former pet owner. The topic I wanted to focus on through my data visualization is that pet owners who have recently become pet owners, or have been one for long now stay away from rehoming their pets in general, especially post pandemic. Pet rehoming has complicated implications especially for the animals who go through multiple homes and family changes that affect them emotionally. The main idea through this data visualization is also to depict how pets rehoming has reduced especially post the pandemic which talks about how pandemic restrictions, work from home has had an impact on pet owners. 

### Setup
Many pets - mostly dogs and cats are considered for this data visualization, have been surrendered by their owners for numerous reasons pre pandemic thus owing to rehoming of these pets

### Conflict
Pets that were surendered get rehomed, which stimulates anxiety, fear and sadness in many. Pet owners have multiple reasons to relinquish their pets that range from personal problems like allergies or a new baby in house to financial issues for pet supplies and medical care and majorly ample time to spend with their pets

### Resolution
In recent years pets being rehomed has been reduced owing to increased adoption and pandemic impact that have made pet owners more open to keeping their pets. There is also improvement in terms of animal shelters providing assistance to pet owners. 

## Initial sketches

## Supporting Data
There are couple of researches that involved in understanding re-homing, relinquishment/ surrendering by owners and COVID impacts on pet adoption or retention
<br/>
Firstly, I learned about re-homing from a Scientific Research publishing article - "Goodbye to a Good Friend: An Exploration of the Re-Homing of Cats and Dogs in the U.S." This article has a compehensive analysis on the who, what and how are animals being replaced in the US. Demographics of people re-homing pets, their reasons and ways of re-homing as well as the statistics for how many pets category wise (dogs and cats) have been studied throuh surveys and data collected from animal shelters.
