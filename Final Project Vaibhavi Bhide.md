# Final Project - Part I

## Outline
As part of my final project I wanted to focus on animal welfare as it holds a soft spot for me as a former pet owner. The topic I wanted to focus on through my data visualization is that pet owners who have recently become pet owners, or have been one for long now stay away from rehoming their pets in general, especially post pandemic. Pet rehoming has complicated implications especially for the animals who go through multiple homes and family changes that affect them emotionally. The main idea through this data visualization is also to depict how pets rehoming has reduced especially post the pandemic which talks about how pandemic restrictions, work from home has had an impact on pet owners. 

### Setup
Many pets - mostly dogs and considered considered for this data visualization, have been surrendered by their owners for numerous reasons pre pandemic thus owing to rehoming of these pets

### Conflict
Pets that were surendered get rehomed, which stimulates anxiety, fear and sadness in many. Pet owners have multiple reasons to relinquish their pets that range from personal problems like allergies or a new baby in house to financial issues for pet supplies and medical care and majorly ample time to spend with their pets

### Resolution
In recent years pets being rehomed has been reduced owing to increased adoption and pandemic impact that have made pet owners more open to keeping their pets. There is also improvement in terms of animal shelters providing assistance to pet owners.
