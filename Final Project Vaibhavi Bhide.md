# Final Project - Part I

## Outline
As part of my final project I wanted to focus on animal welfare as it holds a soft spot for me as a former pet owner. The topic I wanted to focus on through my data visualization is that pet owners who have recently become pet owners, or have been one for long now stay away from rehoming their pets in general, especially post pandemic. Pet rehoming has complicated implications especially for the animals who go through multiple homes and family changes that affect them emotionally. The main idea through this data visualization is also to depict how pets rehoming has reduced especially post the pandemic which talks about how pandemic restrictions, work from home has had an impact on pet owners.
