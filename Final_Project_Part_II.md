## Script
Hi, I'm Vaibhavi and through this data visualization project, my aim is to emphasize the two call for actions essentially: 1. As a prospective pet adopter, it's important to know the amount of work involved and be fully aware and responsible to take care of their pets throughout the pet life as pet abandonment has so many consequences which aren't just bad for the pet but also for the owner. 2. As a pet owner, it's important to retain their pets as far as possible and take necessary help from animal shelters to take care of their pets. I spoke with three friends who provided feedback on my shorthand storyboard. The questions I asked them were

1. Is the title easy to understand?
2. Whether they understood the story overall
3. Were the data visualizations easy to grasp
4. Did they find the data viz interesting enough to keep reading?
5. What were some improvements in terms of charts that they could suggest?
6. Was the story coherent in terms of visualization backed by data as proof?
7. Was the call for action evident and did they realize the gravity of the situation from the story?


Overall, I also tried to gauge feedback from their attentiveness, pauses on some screen part and overall description that they talked about after going through my storyboard.

## User Research
My first user is a male in late 20s who is a cat owner for 6 years now. He knows already how much work is required to take care of his cat and also understands how a pet could get affected when abandoned. Following was his feedback on going through my storyboard:

1. First the title said "Covid Impact on pet adoption and retention", which he suggested to change to "Impact of Covid on.."
2. The title isn't legible so either change the font, color or position
3. The line increase chart in the Reveal section that shows pet adoption has increased could be changed because it didn't fit with the story
4. Try to fit the data visualization charts on one screen such that it's not too big to view nor too small to read
5. The story was easy for him to understand
6. The data visualization was easy enough to grasp but he got a wrong impression of the first data visualization that talks about the reasons for pet surrender. He thought that pet adoption has decreased since that is the main moral of the story and hence the first visualization that he saw made him instantly wonder why does the graph depict a decrease. 
7. Some infogram use was what he suggested to make the data visualization more interactive
8. The story seemed coherent to him but would have liked to see an integration of story and data rather than putting it on sequentially 
9. The call for action was evident but he suggested to include some data regarding the impact of abandonment on pets which is vital for the call for action


My second user was a female in her 20s again who too has a pet cat that she recently adopted! She mentioned that she got her cat from the cat's foster home and that she realized how even a temporary foster home settlement for a pet can make them go through the settling and unsettling which causes them separation anxiety. The feedback she gave me was as follows:

1. The title was again not visible properly to her.
2. She liked the story part in the Reveal section but said that she would have loved to see an overlap between story and data
3. She gave me the idea to embed my flourish graphs into the storyboard so that way they are more interactive and readable.
4. The call for action was properly stated but again got the feedback to include some more data related to pet mental health that gets affected due to rehoming to make the call for action more evident. 
5. She gave me an idea to integrate my story and data by the use of a persona who has a pet or recently adopted one and the stages they went through
6. The data sources was something she liked but thought that the charts could be more intuitive so that the reader need not read much of the content and still grasp the story easily


My third user was male who is in his 60s and has an eye for detail in general. Currently, he does not have a pet but wishes to have one. He has had a pet during his childhood but its been ages since then. As a former pet owner he understands the seriousness of pet abandonment and was happy to provide the following feedback formy story:

1. The title didn't bother him much and he didn't comment on its visibility.
2. The Reveal section story he liked and thought that probably there could be some better way to refine the story in the reveal section by including some data points and highlighting them. 
3. For the charts his attention was drawn to the pattern of alternately using text on left and image on right and said that while that is a good idea for a narrative, it starts seeming monotonous. His suggestion was to incorporate text over media in between to keep the reader engaged. 
4. For the data is the charts, he said that I needed to darken my X and Y axes titles and increase the size of the graph on geographic data from animal humane society because the data provided on the title ribbon isn't visible.
5. Lastly, he said that the draft looks good but he would like to see more easy to read charts or rather charts that interest the reader!


### Similar Findings:
1. Use of more data that shows the impact on pets mental health is what 2 of my users suggested
2. Use of more interactive and infogram charts is what all the users wanted in the story
3. Use of a better method to integrate my story and data to make it coherent than having a sequential version of story and then data charts

### Different Findings:
1. One finding that partcularly interested me was the alternate pattern usage my third user talked about. It's so simple but still holds so much weightage in terms of holding reader's attention.
2. Use of persona was another thoughtful idea that my user 2 provided.
