# **My Portfolio**
This is my data viz portfolio!

### **About me**<br/>
As a product enthusiast, I want to give my undivided attention to solve customer pain points by being innovative and creative. My goal is to understand customer asks and work on them by doing customer requirement analysis and market research to provide solutions.

With sufficient three-year FinTech experience, I have gained the understanding of big project development cycles. From my experience, the most crucial aspect learnt would be that development is not the only major ‘behind the scenes’ task. Taking up new product features, after understanding customer feedback and pain points, prioritizing them to go-lives, then digging up details of new feature expectations, discussing them with the engineers and architects, and finally planning the implementation are all the main tasks involved toward getting a product to fruition. Concurrently, collaboration with cross-functional teams to stay in sync, setting up details for new development, sometimes imparting knowledge training to new joiners are the activities that surround the corporate world!  

Since I have worked as a technology analyst and have a computer science degree, I understand what it takes to build a quality product that is cohesive, user-friendly, scalable, appealing and fully serves the purpose that a customer expects. My comfort level lies with working at an intersection of developing the product and management activities such as leading calls with stakeholders to strategize product roadmap, come up with ideas to resolve discrepancies and collaborate with interdependent teams.

Now that I have worked in the development world, my master’s at Carnegie Mellon University has provided such rewarding experiences through my course projects in New Product Management, Consumer Behavior and Management Consulting. These projects gave me the chance to learn MVP development, wireframe designs, client surveys and data analysis, client consulting meetings and small but significant management hacks!

With this mix of skill set, I now aim to be the workhorse to understand customer journey and provide unique insights to develop viable products

### **What I hope to learn**<br/>
I hope to learn great data visualization techniques from this course because I not only like working on charts but they also could be my future bread and butter.
I would like to learn techniques to reduce noise from a given chart
Make story telling using data easily readable
