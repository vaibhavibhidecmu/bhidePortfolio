# **My Portfolio**
This is my data viz portfolio!

### **About me**<br/>
As a product enthusiast, I want to give my undivided attention to solve customer pain points by being innovative and creative. My goal is to understand customer asks and work on them by doing customer requirement analysis and market research to provide solutions.

With sufficient three-year FinTech experience, I have gained the understanding of big project development cycles. From my experience, the most crucial aspect learnt would be that development is not the only major ‘behind the scenes’ task. Taking up new product features, after understanding customer feedback and pain points, prioritizing them to go-lives, then digging up details of new feature expectations, discussing them with the engineers and architects, and finally planning the implementation are all the main tasks involved toward getting a product to fruition. Concurrently, collaboration with cross-functional teams to stay in sync, setting up details for new development, sometimes imparting knowledge training to new joiners are the activities that surround the corporate world!  

Since I have worked as a technology analyst and have a computer science degree, I understand what it takes to build a quality product that is cohesive, user-friendly, scalable, appealing and fully serves the purpose that a customer expects. My comfort level lies with working at an intersection of developing the product and management activities such as leading calls with stakeholders to strategize product roadmap, come up with ideas to resolve discrepancies and collaborate with interdependent teams.

Now that I have worked in the development world, my master’s at Carnegie Mellon University has provided such rewarding experiences through my course projects in New Product Management, Consumer Behavior and Management Consulting. These projects gave me the chance to learn MVP development, wireframe designs, client surveys and data analysis, client consulting meetings and small but significant management hacks!

With this mix of skill set, I now aim to be the workhorse to understand customer journey and provide unique insights to develop viable products

### **What I hope to learn**<br/>
I hope to learn great data visualization techniques from this course because I not only like working on charts but they also could be my future bread and butter.
I would like to learn techniques to reduce noise from a given chart
Make story telling using data easily readable

## **General Government Debt Data**<br/>

## **General Government Debt Data**<br/>
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.<br/>
In this chart below, rather a grid of line charts we can view a number of countries and their GDP debt ration across years. From the dataset, "Time" column has been used for labels, Debt-to-GDP ratio values of the GDP is set to values, and in order to create this grid of charts country wise, location from the dataset is selected under "grid of charts". The date range is set min(1995) to max (2021).<br/>
To make the graph look more like sparklines, some styling changes have been made - opacity is set to 1, radius of dots = 0.1, and final dot scale is set to 300%<br/>

## **GDP Data using Coloumn chart (grouped)**<br/>
In the given chart below, the Debt to GDP ratio is depicted country wise in a grid across a span to time range - 1995 to 2021. The Y-axis has the Debt-to-GDP ratio for all the countries. To have better vizualization, the bars of the graph have optimum spacing configured to 30. The X-axis date ranges have been configured to be at the bottom only so that the chart looks clutter free. From the chart one can realize that overall (considering all the countries), the Debt-to-GDP ratio has either remained steady over the years or has increased. The title has been given relevant to the chart so that reader can understand what to expect from the grid of charts. 
### **Different Data Visualization Methods**<br/>
I tried to use area graph, pie chart and steamgraph to visualize the same data. The area graph gives a similar output like the line graph with the exception of having a shaded area that considers the entire value of the points upto the line. Steamgraph alowed to identify the trends over the time range by showing throughs and peaks. I decided to choose the bar graph because it depicts every year as a bar (very similar to area graph except data is depicted as bars) and it looks more readable as bars once the X-axis is labelled to show the years. <br/>
