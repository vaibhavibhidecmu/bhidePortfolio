### The article used for critiquing the data visualization is:
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0257209

#### The article is on "Trends in wildlife rehabilitation rescues and animal fate across a six-year period in New South Wales, Australia"
#### The main idea is to understand main causes of rescue for animal groups - mammals, birds, reptiles in order to understand what rehabilitation efforts need to be focused on. I picked this article particularly because it is somewhat relevant to a topic that is important to me- animal welfare by enhancing emergency vehicles for animals/ pets thereby reducing fatalities. Since I was unable to get direct data for this topic, this article falls close enough.
