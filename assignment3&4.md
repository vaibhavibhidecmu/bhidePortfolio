**Assignment 3 and 4**

**Critique by Design**

### The article used for critiquing the data visualization is:
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0257209

#### The article is on "Trends in wildlife rehabilitation rescues and animal fate across a six-year period in New South Wales, Australia"
#### The main idea is to understand main causes of rescue for animal groups - mammals, birds, reptiles in order to understand what rehabilitation efforts need to be focused on.

## Process of rebuilding visualization
<br/>
A couple of points that I thought confused me:
1. Too many colors are dsitracting and don't emphasize any particular meaning out of the chart
2. Including the total bar is adding no extra value
3. The chart's title is generic and does not convey the message that the major cause of rescues that need to be tackled
<br/>
Keeping these points in mind, I designed a chart as below:
<br/>

<br/>
### The feedback I recieved from my peers when they critiqued my visualization is that:
<br/>
1. They liked the fact that I used colors to highlight the main cause of rescues which are: "
