## **General Government Debt Data**<br/>
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.<br/>
In this chart below, rather a grid of line charts we can view a number of countries and their GDP debt ration across years. From the dataset, "Time" column has been used for labels, Debt-to-GDP ratio values of the GDP is set to values, and in order to create this grid of charts country wise, location from the dataset is selected under "grid of charts". The date range is set min(1995) to max (2021).<br/>
To make the graph look more like sparklines, some styling changes have been made - opacity is set to 1, radius of dots = 0.1, and final dot scale is set to 300%<br/>

## **GDP Data using Coloumn chart (grouped)**<br/>
In the given chart below, the Debt to GDP ratio is depicted country wise in a grid across a span to time range - 1995 to 2021. The Y-axis has the Debt-to-GDP ratio for all the countries. To have better vizualization, the bars of the graph have optimum spacing configured to 30. The X-axis date ranges have been configured to be at the bottom only so that the chart looks clutter free. From the chart one can realize that overall (considering all the countries), the Debt-to-GDP ratio has either remained steady over the years or has increased. The title has been given relevant to the chart so that reader can understand what to expect from the grid of charts. 
### **Different Data Visualization Methods**<br/>
I tried to use area graph, pie chart and steamgraph to visualize the same data. The area graph gives a similar output like the line graph with the exception of having a shaded area that considers the entire value of the points upto the line. Steamgraph alowed to identify the trends over the time range by showing throughs and peaks. I decided to choose the bar graph because it depicts every year as a bar (very similar to area graph except data is depicted as bars) and it looks more readable as bars once the X-axis is labelled to show the years. <br/>
